# Public repo to use free of charge
This repo is to be used totally free of charge and in the context you need.
If you would mention me or tag me in your own materials, I'll be very happy.

The repo contains different slides, PDFs, code examples and other stuff that I use in both live demos, conferences and with clients.

Feel free to fork and contribute to the repo.

Happy reading!
